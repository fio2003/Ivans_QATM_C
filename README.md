# Ivans_QATM_C
This is my fastest(but not multithreaded) version of QATM project. I will make it multithreaded once I finish GPU version.

<b>It is open for everybody, but originally intended for MTSU students that would continue current research</b>

If you want to try it:
<p>  1) download everything.
<p>  2) run <b>make</b>.
<p>  3) enjoy flying numbers.
