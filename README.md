# Ivans_QATM_C
This is my fastest(but not multithreaded) version of QATM project. I will make it multithreaded once I finish GPU version.

<b>I do not allow to copy any line of this code for anybody that did not ever studied or worked in MTSU</b>

If you want to try it:
<p>  1) download everything.
<p>  2) run <b>make</b> in your lovely UNIX console.(need some gcc)
<p>  3) enjoy flying numbers.
